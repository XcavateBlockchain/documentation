# Introduction

The Xcavate community believes that real estate should be accessible and affordable to everyone.

We do this by helping the industry to transition from a trust based system to a truth based one. This starts with a robust and secure digital framework powered by Xcavate and secured by Polkadot. The modular protocol is built by, with and for the industry and its stakeholders; unlocking greater value throughout the whole life cycle of real estate.

Governance of the protocol is managed through a combination of a technical committee and individual token holder voting.

An application layer and Standard Developer Kit (SDK) empowers software developers to add value to the ecosystem.
