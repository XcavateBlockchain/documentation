# Introduction

The Xcavate team believe that real estate should be accessible and affordable to everyone.

We do this by eliminating the need for trust through a modular protocol that delivers trustless tokenised real estate assets secured by Polkadot.

Our initial focus is on the currently very centralised sales and management of global new build real estate market.

We aim to also address the need for trusted centralised entities in the areas of land acquisition, planning & construction to complete the full life cycle of real estate.
