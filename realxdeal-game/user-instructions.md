### How to guess

You are presented with a random property, which has all the key features and some property images to help you make an accurate guess. The game timer will start to count down as soon as the details are displayed. You must enter an amount (numbers only) in the "Enter your guess" imput box and click "Enter" to submit your guess.

### Game result win

Your guess will be compared to the actual property price and if you guess within 1% higher or lower of the real price you will win a random coloured property card which is worth x100 points (there are four different cards in each colour and eight colours in total).

If you guess outside the 1% correct price band but still within the "winning zone" then you will win points.

### Marketplace

If you have more than four of the same coloured property cards, those additional cards do not have any points value, so it is advisable to list them. Once listed other players can offer a colour property card you do not yet have or another colour that you do have but don't have four of. You can either accept or reject an offer.
