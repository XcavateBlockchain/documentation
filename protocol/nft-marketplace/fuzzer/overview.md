# Overview

The **Fuzzer** in the `pallet-nft-marketplace` module is a **testing utility** designed to stress-test the marketplace logic using randomized yet structurally valid input data.

Fuzz testing is essential to uncover vulnerabilities, misbehaving business logic, and edge-case failures within the core marketplace flow such as minting, listing, buying, and bidding NFTs.
