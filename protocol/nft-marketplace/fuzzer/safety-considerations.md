# Safety Considerations

1. Ensure **no panic or storage corruption** on malformed listings or actions.
2. Input validation must gracefully reject malformed NFTs or price values.
3. Protect against **integer overflows** in pricing or fee logic.
4. Simulate extreme volume to test **weight-based rejection** or throttling.
