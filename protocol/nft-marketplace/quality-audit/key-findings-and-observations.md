# Key Findings and Observations

#### **4.1 Functional Correctness**

* All primary actions validated under normal and edge conditions.
* No functional discrepancies found in ownership transfer, pricing updates, or minting flows.

#### **4.2 Data Integrity**

* NFT metadata and listing records verified to remain consistent post-operations.
* Boundary-value tests on metadata length, token ID overflow, and price fields passed.

#### **4.3 Performance**

* Benchmark weights for high-volume listing and bidding transactions fall within acceptable thresholds.
* Simulated load testing (e.g., concurrent buy/list requests) did not reveal system bottlenecks.

#### **4.4 Code Quality**

* Follows modular design with clear separation of concerns.
* Extensive inline documentation and external module references.
* No significant warnings or critical issues detected via static analysis tools.

#### **4.5 User and Market Protection**

* Validations correctly reject unauthorized actions (e.g., unauthorized transfers, invalid bids).
* Reentrancy and overflow vulnerabilities mitigated through design and testing.
* Event logs emit accurate and complete traceable information for audit purposes.
