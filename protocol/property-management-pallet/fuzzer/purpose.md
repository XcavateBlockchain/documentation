# Purpose

1. Detect failures in **ownership transfer**, **property registration**, and **metadata mutation** logic.
2. Stress-test **input constraints** such as maximum metadata length, property valuation overflow, or unauthorized access.
3. Validate **multi-user concurrency** conditions during property bids, updates, and handovers.
4. Ensure **state invariants** hold under randomized transaction sequences.
