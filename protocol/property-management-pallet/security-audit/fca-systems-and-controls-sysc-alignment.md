| System and change controls                 | Runtime versioning and migration tests ensure controlled deployments |
| Integrity and reliability of systems       | Validated via unit tests, fuzzing, and reproducible results          |
| Resilience to attack or failure            | Bounded storage, error isolation, and defensive programming patterns |
| Audit trail and traceability               | Events act as immutable logs accessible to off-chain consumers       |
| Role-based access and approval segregation | Calls enforce origin validation and ownership checks                 |
