# NIST Alignment Summary

| NIST Function | Focus Area                                  | Audit Action                                                   |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Identify      | Risk surface mapping, access boundaries     | Analyzed dispatchables and access control gates                |
| Protect       | Access control, data encryption, validation | Ensured all mutation calls require `ensure_signed` or `Root`   |
| Detect        | Logging and event traceability              | Verified consistent `Event` usage and logging patterns         |
| Respond       | Error handling and fail-safe logic          | Ensured `Result` usage, bounded arithmetic, reject-on-failure  |
| Recover       | State migration, failover capacity          | Confirmed versioned storage and `on_runtime_upgrade()` pattern |
