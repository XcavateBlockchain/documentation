# Safety Considerations

1. Fuzzed proposals should **not bypass access control or business logic**.
2. Output must always **fail safely** (i.e., reject invalid input, not panic).
3. Storage should remain **consistent and recoverable** post-test.
4. Chain weight and fee calculation must remain within expected bounds.
