# Overview

The Property Governance Pallet serves as the backbone of property registration, ownership tracking, and governance actions (such as disputes, claims, and transfers) within the Xcavate Protocol.

A Quality Audit ensures the palletâ€™s logic, performance, security, and compliance with protocol governance requirements are fully validated before any runtime upgrades or public releases.
