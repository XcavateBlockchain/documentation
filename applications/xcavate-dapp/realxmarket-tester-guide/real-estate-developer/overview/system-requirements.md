# System Requirements

Here are the latest basic system requirements for Android and iOS apps as of August 2025:

### Android App

* Operating System: Android 10 or above required. Many new apps are now expected to target Android 13+ for best compatibility and performance, but Google Play requirements specify:
  * New apps and updates submitted after August 31, 2025: Must target Android 15 (API level 35).
  * Minimum Android OS to run new apps: Android 10+ is the lowest practical baseline, with many apps recommending Android 12+ for full feature support.
* RAM: Minimum 4GB is recommended; lower RAM devices may experience performance issues.
* Processor: Any modern quad-core CPU or better.
* Screen: Over 5 inches for optimum experience.

### iOS App

* Operating System: iOS 17 or newer is increasingly required:
  * Many major apps now require iOS 17 or above to install and receive updates.
  * As of April 2025, all NEW iOS apps and updates must be built with iOS 18 SDK. However, you can set your minimum supported version lower (but practical app support trends are iOS 16/17+).
* Device: iPhone XR or newer. For best longevity, iPhone 13 lineup or newer is recommended, as earlier models may be phased out of OS support soon.
* RAM: Minimum 3GB recommended for a smooth experience.

### **Summary for Testers**

* For Android, test primarily on devices with Android 10 or higher and at least 4GB RAM. Prioritize testing on Android 13–15 with strong hardware for optimal experience and upcoming Play Store requirements.
* For iOS, focus on iOS 17+ devices (iPhone XR or later), using iOS 18 if possible to match new submission standards.

These requirements ensure your app will run smoothly for most users and comply with the latest Google Play and App Store guidelines for 2025.
