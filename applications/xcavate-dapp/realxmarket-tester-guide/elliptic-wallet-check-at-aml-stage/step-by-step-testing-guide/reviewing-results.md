# Reviewing Results

For low-risk wallets:

* Proceed with normal verification.

For high-risk wallets:

1. Review Ellipticâ€™s detailed exposure report (shows percentage of funds linked to illicit sources).
2. Check related risk categories (e.g., mixers, darknet markets, sanctioned entities).
3. Determine action: Approve, Reject, or Escalate for further review.
