### ⚙️ Settings

The **Settings** section lets you manage your account's security, wallet credentials, developer options, and access helpful links like the FAQ or whitepaper. Here's how to navigate and use each option:

#### 🔐 1. Show Mnemonics

This is your **secret backup phrase** used to restore your wallet. It’s super important.

* Tap on **"Show mnemonics"**.
* You’ll be asked to confirm your identity (Face ID/Passcode or similar).
* Once unlocked, you’ll see your **mnemonic phrase** (usually 12 or 24 words).
* **Write it down somewhere secure** — don’t screenshot or share it.

⚠️ If you lose your phone and don’t have this phrase, **you’ll lose access to your wallet permanently**.

### 🪪 Manage Kilt DID

This section allows you to view and manage your **Decentralized Identifier (DID)**, which is used to link your communications, documents and investments.

Here’s how to understand and use each part of this screen:

#### 🧾 DID Mnemonics

These 12 words (e.g., “flat high label mobile...”) act as your **backup identity** for the DID. If you ever need to recover your identity, these mnemonics are what you’ll use.

* Tap the **“Manage Kilt DID”** section from the **Settings** menu.
* You’ll see your **DID Mnemonics** displayed in a sentence-like list.
*   **Write these down and store them somewhere safe.**

    > ⚠️ Just like wallet mnemonics, if you lose these, your identity is gone for good.

#### 🧠 What are mnemonics?

Not sure what these words are for?

* Tap on **“What are mnemonics?”**
* You’ll be taken to a helpful explanation (or possibly a link) that breaks it down for you.
* This is great for new users who’ve never interacted with a Web3 identity before.

#### 👤 What are DIDs?

DIDs are how Web3 apps recognize you — like a **secure digital ID**.

* Tap on **“What are DIDs”**
* This provides a beginner-friendly explanation of how DIDs work, how they’re used in realXmarket, and why they matter.

Understanding your DID means better control over your personal data and how it’s used.

#### 🗑️ Delete DID

If you ever want to **remove your identity** from the app:

* Tap **“Delete DID”** (⚠️ the red button at the bottom).
* Confirm that you understand this will **delete your DID permanently**.
* Your identity is now removed from the app.

#### 4. Log Out (Delete Private Key)

This will **log you out** and permanently remove your wallet from the device.
