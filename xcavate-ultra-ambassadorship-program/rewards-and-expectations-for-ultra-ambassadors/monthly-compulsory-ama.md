# Monthly Compulsory AMA

Every Ultra Ambassador is required to attend one AMA session per month with the Xcavate core team. This will help us:

* Review monthly achievements and highlights.
* Share feedback and identify areas of improvement.
* Strengthen our collaboration and synergy as a team.  \


AMA sessions will typically hold at the end of each month. Final dates and times will be\
communicated in advance.

\
Your passion, creativity, and commitment are what make the Xcavate ecosystem thrive. Letâ€™s lead by example, inspire others, and take Xcavate to greater heights!
