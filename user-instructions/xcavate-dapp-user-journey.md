# realXmarket user journey

Any page users land on will direct them to having the correct credentials. For the purpose of this documentation we have used the homepage to start their journey. This page explains the purpose of the dApp and the key stages throughout the process.

**1.0 User Verification**

To interact with the realXmarket dApp, all users must have already gone through the DID/KYC/KYB/AML process (through a regulated verifiable provider) in order to be able to call any functions or submit any transactions.

**2.0 User Accounts**

There are currently four types of user accounts. If a user has passed KYC, KYB & AML then they choose an account type.

The account creator can add a company DID and other team mates.

**2.11 Adding a property**

A real estate developer can add a property by clicking the "add property" button and filling in the form.&#x20;

A partially completed form will be saved and can be edited at any time.

Once all the fields have been completed and the "list" button clicked the property will be verified using several preconfigured oracles.

If there is a problem then a field may need to be amended prior to resubmitting.

If all checks have passed, then the property will appear in the marketplace and the property tokens are available to be purchased.

**3.3 Property token sale**

If its the first time the property has been listed, then all of the property tokens will need to be purchased before the Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV) can be created.

**3.4 Property token refund**

Should all of the tokens not be sold within a specified time period (30 days). Then the funds will be returned to the buyers and the tokens burnt.

**4.0 Legal process**

Once the last property token(s) have been purchased an API creates a Limited Liability Partnership (LLP), which is the legal entity that owns the property. All the property token holders are the legal partners in that company and can vote on all property ownership based decisions.

**5.0 Letting process**

Once the SPV has been created a letting agent can "claim" the property and rent it out on behalf of the property token holders SPV.

**6.0 Property Management**

Contracts are electronically signed between the Letting Agent and the SPV.

**6.1 Rental income distribution**

The first months rental for a property (less fees) is deposited by the letting agent. The is to be used as a float to pay for costs relating to the day to day running of the property. All other months rental income is to be distributed to the property token holders wallets based on the number of tokens they hold.

**6.2 Property voting**

All property token holders based on their token holding can vote on all decisions of the property management over and above a pre-determined threshold (initially defaulted to Â£500).

A property token holder can propose a vote based on certain criteria.

**7.0 Secondary Market**

Any property token holder can re-list the property tokens back on to the realXmarket within the pre-determined lower and upper price band based on current market value.

Potential buyers can then make offers to the seller.

The sale is concluded once an offer has been accepted.
