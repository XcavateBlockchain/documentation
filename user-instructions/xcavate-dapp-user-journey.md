# realXmarket user journey

Any page users land on will direct them to having the correct credentials. For the purpose of this documentation we have used the homepage to start their journey. This page explains the purpose of the dApp and the key stages throughout the process.

**1.0 User Verification**

To interact with the realXmarket dApp, all users must have already gone through the DID/KYC/KYB/AML process (through a regulated verifiable provider) in order to be able to call any function or submit any transaction.

**1.1 Digital Identifier (DID) creation**

If it is the users first time to the application they will need to create a new DID. The DID is like an account reference code that will be used to record all data relating to the users account.

**1.2 Know Your Customer (KYC) / Know Your Business (LYB) / Anti Money Laundering (AML) checks**

In order to be regulatory compliant all users must complete a process that verifies the users personal (and business) data. Once completed, verifiable credentials will be stored on the users device and presented when required to perform specific tasks.

Watch this video to understand the process for the personal identity check.

Once you have these credentials then when you log on you will be asked to present your credentials. This all happens without any need to share any actual documents, so none of your personal data is ever stored on the realXmarket app..

**2.0 User Accounts**

There are currently four types of user accounts. If a user type button is clicked for the first time, then the user is prompted to connect / create a Digital Identifier (DID), which is attributed to their user account. Once a DID has been set then a user needs to pass an independent KYC & AML process through an accredited partner.

A returning user will simply be logged in and directed to their profile.

If there is a problem then a field may need to be amended prior to resubmitting.

If all checks have passed, then the property will appear in the marketplace and the property tokens are available to be purchased.
