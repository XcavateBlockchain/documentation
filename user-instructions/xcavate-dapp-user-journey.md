# realXmarket user journey

Any page users land on will direct them to having the correct credentials. For the purpose of this documentation we have used the homepage to start their journey. This page explains the purpose of the dApp and the key stages throughout the process.

**1.0 User Verification**

To interact with the realXmarket dApp, all users must have already gone through the DID/KYC/KYB/AML process (through a regulated verifiable provider) in order to be able to call any functions or submit any transactions.

**2.0 User Accounts**

There are currently four types of user accounts. If a user has passed KYC, KYB & AML then they choose an account type.
